## What is this app?

It's my small project connecting some basic React Native / JS functionalites into a fun app to count the time you spend on a lunch break during work and converts it into amount of money earned (based on provided monthly income and currency) and number of Big Macs that can be bought in a local McDonald's.

Isn't it fun?


## Usage

1. Choose the local currency from the dropdown
2. Enter the monthly income 
3. Submit by clicking the timer emoji
4. Press Start when starting the break
5. Press Stop when stop the timer
6. Your break gain should be visible as well as Big Mac equivalent
7. Select either of three button to resume timer, reset the timer or reset the app
